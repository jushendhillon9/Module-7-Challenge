Description: The Module 9 Challenge tasked me with creating a command-line application that dynamically generates a professional README.md file from a user's input using the Inquirer package. I used the built using the fs module and inquirer package using the command line. It takes input from the user and creates a unique, separate README file. When the links in the table of contents in the README file are clicked, the screen jumps to that section.
